                        Completed people card with the exceptions of verifying Evon's GitHub account name, and fixing the
                        bug that occurs when the user moves the mouse out of the image before the animation chain is complete.
                        The card can be accessed <a href="card/index.html">here</a>.

                        Began coding Evon's people card. Gathered and Photoshopped necessary images. Completed basic movements.
                        Waiting on receiving Evon's picture to fine tune and complete the animation sequence.

                        Brainstormed ideas for Evon's people card. Developed the following ideas:

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-xs-6">
                            <img src="img/cardIdea1.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">

                                On hover, the background fades to a beach scene and an animated gif of a quantum model
                                atom drops from above. Then a lightsaber hilt appears in Evon's hand. The lightsaber ignites with audio.

                                On hover, the background fades to a Matrix-like gif of binary code.
                                Then a Dunkin Doughnuts coffee cup appears in Evon's hand.

                                On hover, an alligator appears in the image. An Ironman helmet appears on Evon's head, and
                                an Ironman arm moves out and fires at the alligator. The alligator disappears from the image.

                        Met with Evon Perez, for whom I will be making a people card. After aimlessly searching for a
                        Dunkin Doughnuts so that he could get coffee, we talked at the Clover Cafe. I learned the following
                        about Evon:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evon likes Star Wars; he even likes episode VII.</li>
                        <li>He also a fan of the Avengers franchise, and the Marvel universe as a whole</li>
                        <li>His career goal is to go into quantum computing research, where he would eventually like to be an engineer</li>
                        <li>Evon used to live in Florida near a small pond where authorities would periodically have to remove alligators</li>
                        <li>He strongly prefers Dunkin Doughnuts coffee over Starbucks coffee</li>
                    </ul>
