                        I couldn't let Google go. I believe I've found a way to make it work by placing each element in
                        it's own svg tag, and anchoring that tag on the map via lat & long. Essentially, I would have a
                        Google maps interface with custom overlays, but D3 would be controlling the animation within each
                        overlay. If necessary, each svg could communicate with the other via global variables in the JS code.
                        The net effect would appear to be a single animation, when in reality it would be a orchestration
                        of several simultaneous events. I just need to test to make sure that the position of the polygons
                        will remain predictable as the perimeters change.

                        Researched other JS plugins recommended by Bakhtiar. I will likely be using the timeline module
                        in vis.js for the timeline section of my interface.

                        Began exploring the possibility of using Google Maps as an connected backdrop to the d3 map. This
                        is likely possible, but there is no straightforward way to do it on the scale that I will be working
                        on. I will come back to this once more of the base design is complete.

                                There will be a control/data box at the bottom of the screen that is split into three sections.
                                On the left will be a mini map that consistently shows the whole world, even when the main map is
                                zoomed in. In the primary, central box, the timeline control will reside at the top. Below will be
                                a space for currently selected civilization data. The rightmost section will contain the name of
                                the current era (Iron Age, Classical Age, etc.), a top five list of the largest civilizations, and
                                a "Next Turn" button. Above the control/data box will be a togglable box that display a text summary
                                of the events of the time period.

                                To the left of the map, event boxes will still drop down as they occur. On hover of
                                a box, the region of the map where the event occured will be highlighted. On click of a box, a modal
                                window will appear with a detailed description of the event.

                                To the right of the map, will be a togglable box that displays historical figures as they are alive.
                                The images will have a border the same color as their culture group. On click, a modal window with
                                text information about the figure will appear.

                                On the map itself, the current year will display on the top left of the screen. All political regions
                                will be clickable to update the data in the data box below. Icons representing famous sites/cities
                                will appear on the map as long as they are in existence. I would like, at some point, to encode
                                population information on the map, perhaps through color density.

                        Finalized the color/culture encodings by taking into account similar cultures as well as where each
                        culture would be on the map throughout history to ensure that there would be no significant visual
                        issues requiring a further splitting of culture groups. Settled on 16 culture categories, and one

                        will fall down as boxes on the left side of the screen: when clicked this boxes will open a modal
                        window with a description of the event. A togglable box on the right side will display significant
                        historical figures as they are alive. The bottom of the screen would contain a text summary of the
                        current time in history.

                        ancient times to the 1800's to see what consistencies could be leveraged. Determined that six of the
                        major language family groupings used in McEvedy's Ancient World altas would suffice for European
                        and near European history. However, due to the prevalance of the Indo-European familily, it will
                        need to be split into 5-7 additional groups. Includinging five additional major language families
                        would sufficiently encompase the rest of the world. Major language families with minimal historical
                        significance will be universally as grey. This creates a total of 15-17 necessary colors.

                        Similar colors should be assigned to similar cultures to avoid confusions. My synesthetic preferences
                        won't work here.

                        Met with Evon Perez, for whom I will be making a people card. After aimlessly searching for a
                        Dunkin Doughnuts so that he could get coffee, we talked at the Clover Cafe. I learned the following
                        about Evon:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evon likes Star Wars; he even likes episode VII.</li>
                        <li>He also a fan of the Avengers franchise, and the Marvel universe as a whole</li>
                        <li>His career goal is to go into quantum computing research, where he would eventually like to be an engineer</li>
                        <li>Evon used to live in Florida near a small pond where authorities would periodically have to remove alligators</li>
                        <li>He strongly prefers Dunkin Doughnuts coffee over Starbucks coffee</li>
