                        populating the toggle box. Each character image is surrounded by a border that is the same color
                        the character's corresponding culture. I just need to fix an issue with some text overlap, and
                        write the code to fill and trigger the modal window when the character is clicked.

                        I went to Sprout Space tonight, and formulated a plan for the character coding. Then I spent the
                        rest of the time helping Faisal and Molly build a wooden arcade game container. It was a great
                        night! We'll be meeting again to finish it up on Monday.

                        Events coding is complete. During the era transition the system checks a tsv file for any events
                        that happened during that era. If any events are found, notification boxes for each event fall down
                        on the left hand side of the screen and stack on top of each other (I'm pretty proud of this effect).
                        Each box contains an image that signifies the type of event that it represents. When the user clicks
                        on a box a modal window is updated with information about that event (again from the tsv file) and
                        is displayed. When the user closes the modal window, the corresponding notification box is removed
                        from the DOM, and any boxes that were stacked on top of it fall down to fill the vacuum (This
                        effect is awesome too!). All I have to do to add more events is update the tsv file; everything
                        else is automated in the code.

                        Alec is going to look into a solution for the disconnected D3 path issue. I completed the region
                        labeling code, using a logarithm and path.area to scale the label size based on region size. I also
                        set the update function to check each proposed font size against a threshold to prevent small labels
                        from being displayed and cluttering up the view area. I need to create a tooltip for the resulting
                        non-labeled regions. I added a button to control the era change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Added dynamically generated largest nation statistics based on path area and whether or not the
                        region represents an actual nation or just a general area of loosely associated peoples (based on
                        a value I added to each nation in the nation table.)

                    <p>
                        Created an era table to store era-specific information such as era date, json filename, and era
                        description. Modified the json loading process to use information from this table, and to
                        automatically adjust which file needs to be loaded as the era's progress. Now, when I create a
                        new era all I have to do is add a new row to this table, and the JavaScript does the rest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the era description toggle box pulls the description from the era table. I just need to add
                        the content.

                        I fixed two of the three problems with the transition: To fix the node increase issue, I wrote a
                        homogenizeNodes function that runs on each GeoJSON file as it is loaded. It compares the number
                        of nodes in a region to the max nodes as listed the region csv file. If the current number of
                        nodes is lower than that max, it artificially adds enough nodes stacked on top of the other at
                        the beginning of the path to make up the difference. This worked nicely to fix the the issue,
                        though now there is a bit of an "unscrolling" effect if the difference in nodes is large.
                        Eventually, I will fix this by dispersing the artificial nodes throughout the path. The opacity
                        issue was essentially a typo, and I will postpone fixing the disconnected paths issue until after
                        the class.

                        I created the next set of region paths (Greater Europe, AD406), and began working on the transition
                        between the eras. I chose to load the data for each era as a separate JSON file to conserve RAM usage.
                        At any given time, no more than three era's worth of data will be loaded: the current era, and the
                        next and previous eras for delay-free transitions. Once an era changes, the era data shifts down
                        (previous is overwritten by current, current is overwritten by next, and next loads the next dataset.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got the transition working effectively; however, there are three primary issues: if a path is
                        transitioning to a larger number of nodes, the new nodes appear immediately at the new location;
                        also, the regions disconnect during transition; finally, when a region is conquered the opacity
                        decreases to 0 immediately instead of following the transition duration.

                         I realized that I will not be able to use the few coordinate files that I created a few years
                        ago in Google Earth. The coordinates are saved in two completely different formats, and it would
                        be faster to recreate them directly as GeoJSON that to write code to convert the format. In addition,
                        the coordinate paths were much lower resolution than I remembered.

                        I found a great website to graphically generate GeoJSON files:
                        <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/maps/documentation/utils/geojson/">Simple GeoJSON Editor</a>.
                        I used this platform to create the first set of region paths for my project (Greater Europe, AD362),
                        and replaced my placeholder D3 world map with this map. Rather than storing all region data in the
                        paths themselves, I am using the path ids to link to a csv file with region name and culture coding.

                        placeholder for the era date. With the addition of a few CSS shadow effects, the look is really
                        starting to come together. Now on to the data. By the end of the week, I would like to have at
                        least one border transition complete, preferably five (~one century of data), as well as the
                        accompanying descriptions and the ability to click on countries. Next week I will work on the
                        events, and character data. If I have time I'll add the global statistics.

                        Ha ha! This is getting so fun! The minimap is completely functional, both as a response to primary
                        navigation and as a control to primary navigation. I also adjusted the travel speed of the primary
                        navigation according to zoom level so that navigation is not uncontrollably fast at high zoom.

                        Zoom function completed. Google does not allow for granular zooming, so I attached a function to
                        the mouse wheel that sensed the direction of rotation and increased or decreased the zoom level
                        to one of three zoom amounts (defined by Google). Used setTimeout and boolean zoomLock variable
                        to decrease the sensitivity of the zoom, and allow time for the smooth transition effect. Created
                        a conversion formula to automatically calculate the appropriate scale for the D3 map. Disabled
                        panning on full zoom out.

                        Struggled to perform animations on the test svg I created in Google Maps. Google does not allow
                        for referencing of an svg once it has been created. After talking with Alec, I went back to the
                        original idea of having a single svg overlayed on Google. Completed simultaneous map movement in
                        on direction when triggered by an arbitrary mouseover event. Proof of concept complete; now it's

                        I couldn't let Google go. I believe I've found a way to make it work by placing each element in
                        it's own svg tag, and anchoring that tag on the map via lat & long. Essentially, I would have a
                        Google maps interface with custom overlays, but D3 would be controlling the animation within each
                        overlay. If necessary, each svg could communicate with the other via global variables in the JS code.
                        The net effect would appear to be a single animation, when in reality it would be a orchestration
                        of several simultaneous events. I just need to test to make sure that the position of the polygons
                        will remain predictable as the perimeters change.

                        major language family groupings used in McEvedy's Ancient World altas would suffice for European
                        and near European history. However, due to the prevalance of the Indo-European familily, it will
                        need to be split into 5-7 additional groups. Includinging five additional major language families
                        would sufficiently encompase the rest of the world. Major language families with minimal historical
                        significance will be universally as grey. This creates a total of 15-17 necessary colors.

                        Began coding Evon's people card. Gathered and Photoshopped necessary images. Completed basic movements.
                        Waiting on receiving Evon's picture to fine tune and complete the animation sequence.

                        Brainstormed ideas for Evon's people card. Developed the following ideas:

                                atom drops from above. Then a lightsaber hilt appears in Evon's hand. The lightsaber ignites with audio.

                        Met with Evon Perez, for whom I will be making a people card. After aimlessly searching for a
                        Dunkin Doughnuts so that he could get coffee, we talked at the Clover Cafe. I learned the following
                        about Evon:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Evon likes Star Wars; he even likes episode VII.</li>
                        <li>He also a fan of the Avengers franchise, and the Marvel universe as a whole</li>
                        <li>His career goal is to go into quantum computing research, where he would eventually like to be an engineer</li>
                        <li>Evon used to live in Florida near a small pond where authorities would periodically have to remove alligators</li>
                        <li>He strongly prefers Dunkin Doughnuts coffee over Starbucks coffee</li>
                    </ul>
